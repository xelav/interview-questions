# Interview questions
Here I'll try to ask some stupid questions but not bother to answer them.

Repo is due to severe cleaning up. Watch the questions at your own risk.

## Guidelines

**TL;DR**: brief, simple, with cool links, as much questions as possible. Any contribution is appreciated.

It is desirable for the answers to be written in your own words, briefly, in laymen`s terms. If the topic of the question is too broad and intricate, you can add links where explanations are provided. If you have links to interesting illustrations don't be shy to add those too. It will be better if the links are clear and understandable as possible - don't just drop some obscure formal definitions.

English language has a higher priority. But you can also write in Russian, to translate it someday later.
If there is some specific terminology in the Russian language on this topic, it is advisable to write it.

There should be as many questions as possible. Tricky and specific one are especially welcomed. Tedious, but popular like "What data types there is in Python?" are also needed. The only condition is that the new questions should not severely overlap with existing ones. Large topics with many questions can be put in a separate section.
